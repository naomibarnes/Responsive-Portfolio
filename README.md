Creation of website using Bootstrap

Project went through many design iterations via bootstrap templates.
I choose this route for simplicity, and to prevent overwhelm.
I wanted to get familiar with bootstrap elements without spending precious hours reinventing a wheel and turning in an unresponsive site.
The project allowed me to become more confident in the hows and whys of html, and getting to see in in action.
In short, I want this website to stand as a symbol of how simple building blocks of understanding and tinkering can create a gorgeous end product.
